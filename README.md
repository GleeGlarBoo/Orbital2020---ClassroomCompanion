# Orbital2020---ClassroomCompanion
ClassroomCompanion is a educational game to allow lower secondary students to learn anywhere and anytime in a fun and engaging manner. This is a project for Orbital2020 and I worked on it with my partner, Chloe.

Full unity project in 'Orbital2020'

ClassroomCompanion is created on Unity. We had no prior Unity knowledge and had picked it up over our year 1 summer break.
