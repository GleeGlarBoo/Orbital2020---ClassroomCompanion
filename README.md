# Orbital2020---ClassroomCompanion
ClassroomCompanion is an educational mobile game to allow lower secondary students to learn anywhere and anytime in a fun and engaging manner. This is a project for Orbital2020 and I worked on it with my partner, Chloe. 

## Overview of Project
ClassroomCompanion is a 2D educational mobile game that allows players (lower-secondary students) to learn on-the-go and have their very own virtual room and a virtual pet. The mobile game acts as an educational resource as there would be daily bite-sized quizzes for students to attempt or a collection of summaries of the topics taught in class for the students to access. The game would make learning interesting and engaging for the players because their furry companions will be accompanying and motivating them along the way. By completing the daily quizzes, players can unlock the mini-game feature, where they can then play a mini-game to earn in-game money and pet experience. In-game money can be used to buy items to decorate their room as they like, and pet experience will enable their pets to level up and acquire new tricks. 

## Motivation
When students learn concepts in classroom settings, there might be a lack of opportunities for them to directly apply what they have learnt quickly in order to solidify their understanding. Since studies have shown that understanding of concepts are better retained if students revise them within a 24-hour period after being taught, the traditional weekly school homework might not be the most effective way of learning. Furthermore, doing homework is widely regarded as a mundane activity, hence students often find themselves procrastinating on them or not completing them at all. 

Many students also tend to struggle to focus in class and might miss out crucial information during lessons. While textbooks help explain the topics in a detailed manner, students may not be able to identify the main points and summarise a topic in an effective manner. 
So, why do students have to find themselves being forced to complete uninteresting and unsatisfying tasks when these tasks could be turned into a fun, rewarding and appealing method of learning and applying concepts taught in class?

## Aim 
We aim to come up with a virtual mobile platform for lower-secondary students to attempt questions related to the concepts taught in class, via the means of daily bite-sized quizzes, anywhere and anytime on their smartphone. Students would also be able to revise with the summaries of the various topics accessible on this platform. To appeal to students, the platform would come in the form of a game and would make use of a reward system to provide instant gratification.  

## Awards
ClassroomCompanion was awarded Artemis Level for Orbital2020, the highest attainable level possible!
